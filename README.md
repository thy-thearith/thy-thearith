# 👋 Hey there, I'm THY THEARITH

Welcome to my digital portfolio repository!

I'm a passionate **Data Architect** with a full-stack engineering mindset. I specialize in designing scalable data systems and building modern software applications that are efficient, maintainable, and user-centric. My professional journey has been shaped by working on high-impact national projects and dynamic product teams where quality, performance, and innovation matter most.

## 🧠 Who Am I?

I’m currently working as a **Data Architect**, focusing on data-driven solutions, system integration, and high-performance application design. Over the years, I’ve evolved from a full-stack developer into a data-focused engineer who bridges backend logic with data architecture — ensuring solutions are robust from code to database.

Here’s a deeper look into what I’ve done:

- 🧩 **Software Engineering for Scale**  
  Developed and maintained applications for large and complex systems, ensuring reliability and maintainability in fast-paced environments.

- 🏅 **SEA Games & ASEAN Para Games – National Impact**  
  Proud contributor to the Game Management System, a flagship initiative funded by the Cambodian government. Played a key role in implementing features and enhancements that supported event operations at a national level.

- 👨‍🔧 **Problem Solver at Core**  
  Diagnosed and resolved performance bottlenecks and bugs, ensuring high system availability and responsiveness.

- 📐 **Architecture & Data Modeling**  
  Designed **conceptual**, **logical**, and **physical data models** using **ER diagrams** and **UML**, ensuring smooth collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- 🔄 **Legacy Modernization**  
  Successfully migrated outdated systems to modern platforms, improving stability, performance, and ease of maintenance.

- 🚀 **Optimization & Performance**  
  Improved application performance by identifying key issues in the codebase and applying targeted optimizations.

- 📅 **Agile Workflow & Team Collaboration**  
  Worked closely with PMs, designers, and developers in Agile environments. Took ownership of tasks and ensured timely delivery based on well-defined timelines.
